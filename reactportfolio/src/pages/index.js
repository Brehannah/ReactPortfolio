<p>My name is Breana Hannah, I attend a full stack development program at Georgia Technical College. I am
    expanding my skills on the daily. This program has opened my eyes to the beauty of technology. I have plenty
    to learn and I am eager to learn it.</p>
<br/>
<p>I am currently located in Richmond Hill, Georgia as I earn my Bachlors Degree. I have a feeling that the
    aspect of learning will never end for me. My motivation for my consistent go-getter spirit is definitely my
    family and the vision that I have for a bright future.</p>
